How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It made it easier to see the bug by comparing all of the lines that had changed from old version to new version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I'd be able to go back and see how I had built a program.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros: You can save exactly when you deem appropriate
cons: You could forget. GD probably will not save when you want to

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
It makes it easier to manage

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows all of the commits and git diff compares to commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can always revert back to a version that worked.

Now that you have workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
keep track of my learning progress and save programs that I may improve later after I've learned what to do
